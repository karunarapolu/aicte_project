# Image Steganography Tool

## Overview

This project is a simple image steganography tool that hides a secret message inside a digital image. It converts the text into ASCII values and embeds these values into selected pixels of the image. The hidden message can later be retrieved by reading the modified pixel values and converting them back into text.

## Problem Statement

In today's digital world, secure communication is essential, yet traditional encryption can sometimes attract unwanted attention. There is a need for covert methods that hide sensitive information within everyday files. This project addresses that need by providing a simple method to embed secret messages in images, allowing for discreet and secure communication without altering the visible appearance of the image.
